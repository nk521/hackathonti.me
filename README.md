## `Idea` What are we thinking?
This platform caters to hackathon hosts and participants alike. 
- The home page shows ongoing and future hackathons in your area
- A host can mail us or fill a form to register a hackathon with required details. 
- Participants register at [Hackathonti.me](url) for the same hackathon or find a past event in the archive.
- Two hours after the hackathon ends, public voting takes place and users are able to vote for 24hrs. These factors include but are not limited to reliability, environment, growth potential, management.
- This decides the _points_, suppose `x` for the hackathon. Consequently, the winning team scores `x` points, first runner up scores `x/2` points and so on! 
- After every 4 months, ranks are calculated for these participant teams and individual hackathons. These ranks are your flaunt-o-meter!

hmmmüí≠

## `Work already done` We did this much! 
gotcha nerdssss
- basic UI skeleton pages
- login/register
- team creation
- date/time logic for hackathons
- winner/runnerup logic
- points logic (ye manual hi hoga.. CTFtime bhi ese hi krta)

## `Work in Progress` Still brainstorming these ones!
under construction kidddoo
- public voting thingy
- join team logic (I was thinking ki team banane pe UUID dedete hai user ko jisse join kr ske baaki bande)
- team slug page pe abhi bas team members, hackathons went and hackathons won hai.. usko chota sa ek kone m 
rkh ke us page ko team blog banana hai.. taaki team explain kr pae ki unhone is hackathon m kya banaya and all

## `Screenshots` How do we look like?

## `Contribution Guide` I want to get started. 
If you would like to update resources on Hackathonti.Me, please:
- Find an issue with a label relevant to your interest. For new contributors, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-bug-blue?style=flat-square" /> or <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-good--first--bug-orange?style=flat-square" /> would do well.
  
- Make a fork of this repository.
- Clone your fork locally.
- Create a new branch to contain your change. Give your branch a descriptive name, such as `update-distribution-options`, or `add-object-fit-example`.
- Make your change using the browser or on your local machine.
- Commit your change.
- Push the branch to your remote fork.
- Make a pull request to the original repo.

If you are not sure how to complete the above steps, GitHub's [Fork a Repo guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) is a good place to start.
