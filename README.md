## `Idea` What are we thinking?
This platform caters to hackathon hosts and participants alike. 
- The home page shows ongoing and future hackathons in your area
- A host can mail us or fill a form to register a hackathon with required details. 
- Participants register at [Hackathonti.me](url) for the same hackathon or find a past event in the archive.
- Two hours after the hackathon ends, public voting takes place and users are able to vote for 24hrs. These factors include but are not limited to reliability, environment, growth potential, management.
- This decides the _points_, suppose `x` for the hackathon. Consequently, the winning team scores `x` points, first runner up scores `x/2` points and so on! 
- After every 4 months, ranks are calculated for these participant teams and individual hackathons. These ranks are your flaunt-o-meter!

## `Work already done` We did this much! 
- Skeleton pages for User Interface (UI) with all the required variables and properties.
- Pages for Login/Register into Hackathonti.Me.
- Logic for Creation of teams for hackathons by participants.
- Logic for Date/Time for hackathons to decide the ongoing, future and past events and move them to archive accordingly.
- Logic to declare Winner and Runner-Ups.
- Logic to decide points for teams and hackathons. This is implemented manually.

## `Work in Progress` Still brainstorming these ones!
- Logic for Public Voting for hackathons.
- Logic to join teams. After a team is created, a UUID could be generated for the participants which will also allow others to join in.
- Is Team Blog is a good idea? Where teams can write about their projects to maintain a project archive. The information for the team like [ team members, hackathons went and hackathons attending ] could be more concisely arranged on the page.

## `Contribution Guide` I want to get started. 
If you would like to update resources on Hackathonti.Me, please:
- Find an issue with a label relevant to your interest. For new contributors, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-bug-blue?style=flat-square" /> or <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-good--first--bug-orange?style=flat-square" /> would do well.
  
- Make a fork of this repository.
- Clone your fork locally.
- Create a new branch to contain your change. Give your branch a descriptive name, such as `update-distribution-options`, or `add-object-fit-example`.
- Make your change using the browser or on your local machine.
- Commit your change.
- Push the branch to your remote fork.
- Make a pull request to the original repo.

If you are not sure how to complete the above steps, GitHub's [Fork a Repo guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) is a good place to start.
